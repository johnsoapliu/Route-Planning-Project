# Route Planning Project

In this project, you will create a route planner that plots a path between two points on a map using real map data from the [OpenStreeMap project](https://www.openstreetmap.org/.).

The OpenStreetMap project is an open source, collaborative endeavor to create free, user-generated maps of every part of the world. These maps are similar to the maps you might use in Google Maps or the Apple Maps app on your phone, but they are completely generated by individuals who volunteer to perform ground surveys of their local environment.

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```
